    Representation languages provide a way to store and retrieve facts
from a computer.   Since English is a grammatically and textually ambiguous
language, representation systems use a more formal language to describe the
world.  The way in which the words or symbols of a language are put together
to form phrases and sentences is termed the ``syntax'' or ``grammar'' of the
language.  
    The next several sections of this tutorial will introduce you to the
syntax of the MRS language.

    MRS is a predicate calculus-like language.  It is based upon
combinations of ``symbols'' into ``terms'' and ``propositions''.  Facts are
stated as N-tuples or lists which describe a relationship between individuals.
The statement

	 (NEIGHBOR BERTRAM ARTHUR)

consists of three symbols.  Neighbor represents a relationship
between the second and third symbols which represent objects (in this case
people) in the world.  The proposition above states that Bertram and
Arthur are neighbors.

    In general, symbols within MRS expressions can represent a number of
things, including objects, functions, relations, actions, etc.  More
specifically, there are three general categories of symbols.

1.  Object symbols name specific objects, concepts or individuals.
    Examples: STANFORD, KENNEDY, ELEPHANTS, BLUE (the color), JEALOUSY")

  (Princ '"

2.  Function symbols represent functions on the objects in the world.
    Examples:  PRESIDENT-OF, HEIGHT-OF, +, COLOR-OF

3.  Relation symbols represent relations between objects in the world.
    Examples: NEIGHBOR, >, TALLER-THAN, =

(defun Terms ()
  (AddToModel '(MaterialPresented Terms))
  (Princ '"
    Sometimes we need to talk about an individual or object that doesn't
have a name (or for whose name we don't know).  For example, Fido's
tail does not have a particular name or symbol associated with it, but
we may need to refer to it.  To solve this problem, symbols can be combined
into more complex expressions to form functional ``terms''.  Examples:")

  (Princ '"

	   (TAIL-OF FIDO)

Expressions of this type along with all symbols are called
terms.  More formally, any N-ary function symbol associated with N terms
(Function term1 ... termN) is a term.")

(princ '"
It is important to note that even though a functional term like 
(MOTHER-OF FRED) may be associated with an individual in the world
named Sally, the database will not automatically know that fact.

   In general, a fact is stated within MRS in the form of a
proposition which consists of any N-ary relation symbol and N terms,

    Quite often facts cannot be stated as a direct fact like (NEIGHBOR
BERTRAM ARTHUR).  For example, you may want to say that Sally is not a
neighbor of Bertram, or that if George fails the test he will be sad.  
Complex propositions such as negations, disjunctions, conjunctions and
contingencies can be expressed as non-atomic propositions using the logical
symbols NOT, OR, AND and IF respectively.")

(defun Quantification ()
  (AddToModel '(MaterialPresented Quantification))
  (Princ '"
    Up to now we have only used symbols that are constants.  Quite often,
however, one needs to refer to arbitrary or unknown individuals.  For example
you might want to say ``Somebody killed George's aunt'' or ``elephants are
grey'' To do this you need to use universally or existentially quantified
symbols")

  (princ '"

	   (EXIST P (KILLED (AUNT-OF GEORGE) P))
	   (ALL E (IF (ELEPHANT E) (= (COLOR-OF E) GREY)))

The proposition (All x1 ... xN (prop x1 ... xN)) states that the proposition
(prop x1 ... xN) is true for all possible values of x1 ... xN.  The proposition
(Exists x1 ... xN (prop x1 ... xN)) states that there is some x1 ... xN for
which (prop x1 ... xN) is true." )

   (Princ '"
    The All and Exist quantifiers can also be nested within each other
or can be used with non-atomic propositions.  For example, you can
state ``for all numbers there is another number that is greater in
value'' with the proposition

        (ALL X (EXIST Y (> Y X)))

Each quantifier can also take multiple variables as arguments.

        (ALL H R (IF (AND (HORSE H) (RABBIT R))
		     (CAN-OUTRUN H R)))            ")

   (Princ '"
Be careful of your use of nested quantifiers.  A change in their position in
respect to each other can change the meaning of the proposition drastically.  
For example the two propositions

        (EXIST X (ALL Y (LOVES X Y)))
        (ALL X (EXISTS Y (LOVES X Y)))

mean ``Every person has someone who loves them'' and ``There is a
person that is loved by everyone'' respectively.  " ))

    You may use a shorthand for specifying universal and leftmost
existential variables.  The prefix character $ denotes a universally
quantified variable, whereas ? will label an existential variable.  To
illustrate this shorthand notation the following examples show
equivalent statements.")

    In this particular instance, MRS finds the implication

    Forward chaining is another type of reasoning that MRS can perform.

side of the new implication, just on the entire implication.  This is not 
an inherit insufficiency of forward chaining, but it is a reasoning 
limitation within the current MRS implementation.")

    From the previous sections on Forward and Backward chaining, it is hard
to see any advantage of one over the other.  From the examples
they appear to be almost exactly the same.  What are the differences?

    The most obvious difference is that forward chaining occurs when you are
building the database.  There is no need to query the database to get the
inference mechanism to work.  On the otherhand, backward chaining occurs
only when a query takes place.")
(Princ '"

    Although the above difference may not influence the choice between the
use of the two reasoning schemes, the following should.  The major
difference between the forward and backward chaining has to do with the
shape of the database that they search best.  If a database has many initial 
facts with implications that determine very few goal states (fan-in),")
  (Princ '"
it is best to use forward chaining.  However, if your database can have
a large number of possible conclusions with a small set of initial facts,
backward chaining is the inference method of choice.  Why?  Because in each
case it is best to limit the amount of time infering facts that will never
be used.")
  (Princ '"

   The following example should shed some light on the subject.

	   (IF (ELEPHANT $X) (PACHYDERM $X))
	   (IF (ELEPHANT $X) (BIG $X))
	   (IF (BIG $X) (HEAVY $X))
	   (IF (ELEPHANT $X) (STRONG $X))")
  (Princ '"

    If we assert the fact (ELEPHANT CLYDE) with the above assertions in the
database, a forward chainer would immediately assert four additional facts,
(PACHYDERM CLYDE), (BIG CLYDE), (HEAVY CLYDE) and (STRONG CLYDE).  If
(ELEPHANT EDWARD) is asserted, four additional facts will be put in the
database.  There are many possible conclusions for each new fact in this 
this database (it has the characteristic of fan-out).")
  (Princ '"

    A backward chainer in this situation would not asserted any new facts
when (ELEPHANT CLYDE) is added, but would create new facts only if a query
is made.  To find out (STRONG CLYDE) there is no need to know (HEAVY CLYDE),
etc., and the backward chainer will not try to prove these facts. ")
  (Princ '"

    It is evident from this example that backward chaining is best to use
with a database like the one above.


    The similarities between the two mechanisms are also important.  Both
forward and backward chaining use the same rule of inference, Modus Ponens.
This method of inference is also entirely separate from the method of search
used to find facts in the database.")
  (Princ '"

Caution!  There are possible problems that can arise using chaining.
One can construct a database that will reason in loops.  MRS, at this time,
is unable to stop circular reasoning, so beware of situations like the
following.")

For forward chaining:
        1)  (IF (AND (INTEGER $X) (INTEGER $Y)) (INTEGER (+ $X $Y)))
	2)  (IF (P A) (P B))

	2)  (IF (P A) (P B))
	    (IF (P B) (P C))

    All analogous situations will cause MRS to loop indefinitely.
